# Brazillian-Ecommerce-Azure-and-Databricks-Data-Engineering-Project

Designed and deployed an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on Azure (ADF, ADLS Gen2, Databricks, Delta Lake, Synapse Analytics) to ingest, transform, and serve large-scale Brazilian e-commerce data.

Implemented a Medallion Architecture (Bronze–Silver–Gold) using PySpark + SQL, improving data quality, consistency, and maintainability across layers.

Built automated ETL workflows in Azure Data Factory with Delta Lake optimization & schema enforcement, and exposed curated tables through Synapse Analytics for SQL-based consumption.

Delivered high-quality, analytics-ready datasets for downstream teams (BI & Analytics), improving query performance, reliability, and time-to-insight.
